                    <p>You're looking at a histogram of salaries given to H1B workers in the software industry. You can filter by year, job title, and state.</p>
                    <p>All data is from <a href="http://h1bdata.info/">h1bdata.info</a></p>

                    <h3>React + d3.js</h3>
                    <p>This site was built with React and d3.js. React is great for handling user inputs and keeping everything in sync. D3.js is great for showing data. Together they make for a wonderful combination.</p>
                    <p>I'm releasing a quick eBook on how I all this works soon. You should tell me if you want it, <a href="https://leanpub.com/reactd3js">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I'm Swizec Teller.</p>
                    <p>I built these graphs because I'm about to apply for an H1B visa, and I wanted to see what to expect. What astounded me most was that Engineers make $20k/year more than programmers.</p>
